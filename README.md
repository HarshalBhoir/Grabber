# Grabber
A wrapper for Youtube-dl for Windows. 

Made with PyQt5 <a ref="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">Website</a> 

Requires you to have youtube-dl.exe in the same folder as this program(Grabber), or in PATH. 
If you want to convert the videos, or otherwise use features of youtube-dl that require ffmpeg,
that also has to be in the same folder as Grabber. 

You can get those programs here:
