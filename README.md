# Grabber
A wrapper for Youtube-dl for Windows. 

 
Requires you to have youtube-dl.exe in the same folder as this program(Grabber), or in PATH. 
If you want to convert the videos, or otherwise use features of youtube-dl that require ffmpeg,
that also has to be in the same folder as Grabber. 

You can get those programs here:
* Youtube-dl here: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/
* ffmpeg here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/

Requirements to use source:

* Python 3.6+ 
* PyQt5 5.9 (Earlier version might work too, worked fine with 5.8 before i upgraded.)
